# EX001. Friday is a mandatory day for Esmorzarets

## Status

[Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded]

## Context

In València, esmorzaret is a culinary tradition that defines both the city and its people: an irrepressible village, proud of its culinary localisms, against the tyranny of globalization, brunch and other customs in the age of orthodoxy.

Here, people show little passion for breakfast yet await the designated time for esmorzaret (between 9:00, for the purists, and 12:00, for the stragglers) with a veneration bordering on the religious. Valencianas and valencianos are brothers and sisters in this sentiment, which like so many others, is the result of the city's agricultural origins.

## Decision

To ensure code quality, Exchange team must go for Esmorzaret every friday before the daily meeting.

## Consequences

Our bellies will be full for the rest of the day; there's no need for breaks.

Eventually, we might end up being late for the daily stand-up.
